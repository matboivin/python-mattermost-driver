## Usage

This project is intended to be used as a library.

```python
from mattermostdriver import Driver

def init_driver(server_url: str, email: str, password: str) -> Driver:
    return Driver(
        {
            "url": server_url,
            "login_id": email,
            "password": password
        }
    )

def start_driver(driver: Driver) -> None:
    """Connect Mattermost Driver to server."""
    driver.login()
```

Example with asynchronous driver:

```python
from mattermostdriver import AsyncDriver

def init_driver(server_url: str, email: str, password: str) -> AsyncDriver:
    return AsyncDriver(
        {
            "url": server_url,
            "login_id": email,
            "password": password
        }
    )

async def start_driver(driver: AsyncDriver) -> None:
    """Connect Mattermost Driver to server."""
    await driver.login()
```
