## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or greater
- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and change it to your working directory.

2. Install the project:

```console
$ poetry install
```

<br />

## Usage

A [Driver](https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/drivers), or client, is an object used to interact with the Mattermost API.

At least the following options must be provided as a dict:

- `login_id` (user account's email address or username) and `password`
- or `token`

Example with synchronous driver:

```python
from scrapermost import Driver

driver: Driver = Driver(
    {
        "hostname": server_hostname,
        "login_id": email,
        "password": password
    }
)

driver.login()
```

Example with asynchronous driver:

```python
from scrapermost import AsyncDriver

driver: AsyncDriver = AsyncDriver(
    {
        "hostname": server_hostname,
        "token": token
    }
)

await driver.login()
```
